# VS2017_S3_File_Directory_Loader
Visual Studio 2017 AWS S3 Recursive Directory Uploader
This solution project takes the information provided by AWS (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HLuploadDirDotNet.html) using the TransferUtility class and streamlines it with Visual Studio 2017. For example utilization of the using Amazon.S3.Model directive is now unnecessary. This program allows you to upload multiple directories with all recursive files and sub-directories directly into you S3 bucket.
